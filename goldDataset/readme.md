#### Gold dataset as case study
- The drug-disease dataset can be obtained from the reference : "Gottlieb, Assaf, et al. "PREDICT: a method for inferring novel drug indications with application to personalized medicine." Molecular systems biology 7.1 (2011)".t 
- The drug-target dataset can be downloaded from the DrugBank: https://www.drugbank.ca/

#### Data describution
- `DrugDisease`: the drug-disease interactions.
- `DrugTarget`: the drug-target interactions.
- `DrugSimMat1`: the drug-drug similarity in drug-disease domain.
- `DrugSimMat2`: the drug-drug similarity in drug-target domain.
- `DiseaseSimMat`: the disease-disease similarity.
- `TargetSimMat`: the target-target similarity.
- `SMat.mat`: the mapping matrix to denote the anchor links across the two domains.

- `validTop20gold.csv`: the top-20 predicted results by our iDrug with validation

### Quick start
